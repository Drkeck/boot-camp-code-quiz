# (boot camp coding quiz) [https://drkeck.github.io/boot-camp-code-quiz/]
The student ran coding quiz for fellow boot camp peers.
admitidly it is a minimal test for my skillset in JS and using web API's
i'd be lying if i said some of the code made me lose sleep or completely rethink
how i did a few thing.

all in all i am proud of what i was able to accomplish!
and i hope to make more amazing things in the future!

some of the save numbers don't save super accurately unfortunatly.
